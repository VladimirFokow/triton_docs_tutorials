## Learning resources

- of course the [official Triton documentation](https://triton-lang.org/main/getting-started/tutorials/index.html)

- [here](https://github.com/hkproj/triton-flash-attention)'s a flash-attention implementation by one of my fav youtubers that comes with an [8 hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy8ChVd_oTM&t=1s)

- and the original flash-attention papers [v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135) & [v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691) (you only really need v2)

- [here](https://github.com/gpu-mode/lectures/tree/main)'s a wider set of GPU kernel guides that includes an intro to Triton in lesson 14
